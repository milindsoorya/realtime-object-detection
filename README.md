# Realtime-object-detection
In this ipython notebook, I created a realtime face detection model using deep learning. 

It uses tensorflow. The data set used is created by me by capturing images from webcam, manually annotating it and the finally augmenting it using a library. The model is suprisingly accurate and works well with the limited data. The cool thing about this is that I can change the input data and it will easily detect any other objects.
